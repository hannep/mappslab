    The goal is to give middle-grades teachers a tool that makes it practical to deliver any Core content through project-based learning. 
    The app puts the power of Google Maps--plus other key tools--into a package that 4th graders can use--with no prior instruction, and very little support.
    The range of capabilities students have within the app gives teachers great freedom to design practical, efficient projects. Students can find and investigate any location on the planet; measure and calculate distances; design or imagine journeys; and create any kind of content, including photographs, video, audio, writing, and math. 
    The Core applications go far beyond social studies. Educators have already designed mini-projects using the app to teach Core curriculum in math, science, creative and non-fiction writing, history, and health.
    The classroom experience appeals to students with many learning styles and many different attitudes toward school. While the students' work is secure, it is also easy to share with parents or partner classrooms anywhere in the world.

    The increased student engagement is measurable. A third-party assessment by experienced teachers rated the control classroom "somewhat disengaged" and the same group "clearly engaged" once the app was brought into play. 
    The educator experience has been very positive during the development of the prototype. Every teacher who was able to use the application for more than a single class session reported significant increase in learning. And the principal whose school used it for several weeks believes the app was largely responsible for more than half the class from (((below wahtever))) to (((whatever whatever))) on the SAGE test in math.
    The measurable learning impact is our current focus. We hope to work with 5 to 10 teachers who are willing to try the app for at least one project. The project would be designed to achieve multiple, specific Core goals chosen by the teacher. The goal would be to collect data on Core performance (((get wording))), but also on 21st-century skills, student engagement, and value to the classroom teacher.
