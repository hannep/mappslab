    <h1>Nothing is more fun than learning.</h1>
    <p class="subheader">MappsLab is a multidisciplinary system of learning designed and developed by educators to empower their fellow teachers to create a classroom environment of engagement and empathetic learning. </p><p>Weâ€™ve worked with middle-grades teachers to create a web application that makes it fast and easy for them to deliver any Core content through project-based learning.</p>

    <h3>Enhancing Your Curriculum, Supporting Your Teaching Philosophy </h3>
    <p>The MappsLab webapp puts the power of Google Maps, enhanced with creative and educational tools, into a package that 4th graders can use with no prior instruction, and very little support. Students can use mapping to tell stories, explore subjects like history, geography, and social studies, and bring math concepts from the abstract into the real world. The range of capabilities students have within the app gives teachers great freedom to design practical, efficient projects. Students can find and investigate any location on the planet; measure and calculate distances; design or imagine journeys; and create any kind of content, including photographs, video, audio, writing, and math. Educators have already designed mini-projects using the app to teach Core curriculum in math, science, creative and non-fiction writing, history, and health. This classroom experience appeals to students with many learning styles and many different attitudes toward school. While the students' work is secure, it is also easy to share with parents or partner classrooms anywhere in the world.</p>

    <h3>Impact and Engagement </h3>
    <p>
Careful research has found an immediate increase in student engagement when MappsLab is introduced in classrooms. A third-party assessment by experienced teachers rated the control classroom "somewhat disengaged" and the same group "clearly engaged" once the app was brought into play. The educator experience has been very positive during the development of the prototype. Every teacher who was able to use the application for more than a single class session reported significant increase in learning. And the principal whose school used it for several weeks believes the app was largely responsible for great progress on SAGE test scores in math. </p>

<p>Measurable learning impact is our current focus. We hope to work with adventurous teachers who are willing to try the app for one project or more, based on specific Core goals chosen by each teacher. We will collect data on Core achievement and also on 21st-century skills, student engagement, and value to the classroom teacher. To get involved, contact us!
