<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
MappsLab has been created and is being developed 
<ul>
<li>to be real classroom and real teacher friendly </li>
<li>to provide an instant example of joyful learning</li>
<li>to empower teachers to take back control of their classrooms and unite as professionals to become the primary agents for educational reform </li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold-philosophy">An engaged classroom is a happy classroom.</span>
MappsLab reconnects teachers and students with their best learning selves, and nothing is more fun than learning. </p>

<p><span class="bold-philosophy">Students move from passive collectors to active creators of their own narratives, turning them into readers, writers, and mathematicians.</span>
MappsLab is designed to be used across the curriculum - a compelling tool to tell stories and make learning relevant. </p>

<p><span class="bold-philosophy">When students learn efficiently, they improve their test scores without sacrificing valuable learning and playtime.</span>
A teacher whose class tests well is freed of pressure to “teach to the test,” reasserting her role as a learning professional without administrative micro-managing. </p>

<p><span class="bold-philosophy">A teacher with parental respect and support have the power to involve parents positively.</span>
Student products demonstrate what students know and the skills they’ve acquired, and can be shared effectively with parents and administrators. </p>

<p><span class="bold-philosophy">Teachers in a social network of learning professionals are empowered to make needed system change from the grassroots up.</span>
MappsLab connects teachers across boundaries, providing opportunities for student collaboration and an antidote for teacher loneliness. </p>
